    p1: "ifty years ago I was an angry young man in my senior year at Cornell University. Mentally and emotionally I was prepared to be one of those African-Americans who would meet my destiny in a struggle against oppression and injustice that was much larger than any one of us, and even much larger than all of us. I thought we were the generation fingered by history to draw the line on America’s ill treatment of its black population. It had to stop with us, in our time.",
    p2: "As I reflect from the perspective of 50 years on the events at Cornell University in April 1969, I feel both regret and pride. I have regrets regarding the individual toll of those events. I’m sorry at the individual level of the people who were hurt. That includes black students who were traumatized; President Perkins who became the scapegoat for the wrath of angry trustees, faculty, and alumni; and professors and their families who were frightened by my angry rhetoric and the spectre of armed students on campus. But I’m not sorry at the institutional level, the broadest of which is the events at Cornell in the context of the racial discrimination and oppression and violence against African-Americans which was common in America at that time. I’m proud that we black students armed ourselves and said, in effect, “we are the generation of African-Americans who will not be intimidated by vigilantes”. The lesson here is that some life situations do not lend themselves to simplistic judgements of who was right or wrong. Sometimes it’s not either right or wrong, it’s both. I was right in April 1969 because our cause was just in fighting a racist society. But I was also wrong because my tactics caused harm to some individuals. I’ve wrestled my entire adult life with this moral ambiguity of April 1969 at Cornell University.",
    p3: "We should remember that 50 years ago America was still engaged in an unresolved battle to secure equal treatment for black Americans in public accommodations, employment, housing, voting, and other civil rights. De jure segregation was enshrined in the law in many states, and de facto institutional discrimination was the social norm throughout America. The petty discrimination of being denied access to public facilities was intended to dehumanize African-Americans, and to proclaim every day that we were different and inferior. The systemic institutional denial of economic opportunities ensured that African-Americans remained poor and powerless. Each previous decade of American history was more brutal in its treatment of the black population. That’s why I’m proud that my colleagues and I had the courage to say that the oppression and intimidation of African-Americans would stop with our generation, and we were prepared to fight about it.",
    p4: "The purpose of reciting this history is not just to remind us of where we have been, but also to focus on how far we have come. There is no point in suffocating our potential for today and tomorrow with irreconcilable animosity over the grievances of the past. The burden is too heavy, and we cannot change the past. That’s why I believe that just as a family cannot heal unless it lets go of yesterday’s anger, so all Americans of every race and creed and ethnicity should be open to reconciliation and healing, otherwise we will never achieve our full potential as a multiracial, multiethnic, and religiously diverse democracy.",
    p5: "Historical reflection also seems to make an undeniable case that African-Americans, other minorities, women, and the LGBTQ community have widespread educational, economic, and social opportunities today which are unprecedented in American history. Does this mean that America has overcome its historical problems? Of course not! The legacy of hundreds of years of slavery and the related physical and psychological barbarity against African-Americans created a scale of human misery and dysfunctionality which cannot be reversed or healed in just 50 years. But is America moving in the direction of civic equality and equal opportunity – unequivocally yes! This in no way diminishes the important work that Black Lives Matters and other groups do today to bring attention to ongoing police and vigilante violence against African-Americans, and widespread poverty among African-Americans. But we should acknowledge and celebrate the truth that for every incident of racial violence against African-Americans which occurs today, the frequency of such incidents was proportionately 50 times greater 50 years ago, and one 100 times greater one 100 years ago! We should acknowledge and celebrate the truth that many millions of African-Americans have lifted themselves out of poverty into the middle class and even higher. We should acknowledge and celebrate the truth that de jure discrimination against African-Americans is no longer enshrined in American law or the judicial system.",
    quote1: "My colleagues and I had the courage to say that the oppression and intimidation of African-Americans would stop with our generation.",
    p6: "So even as I am acutely aware of how far we have yet to go, I am enormously thankful for how far America has come in the past 50 years. I hope America continues this progress and becomes a country which respects and celebrates our diversity within the context of overarching bonds of community.",

    p1: "s was mentioned in the documentary Agents of Change, I was looking forward to the adventure of going to school away from home in the fall of 1968.  I immediately loved the beauty of the Cornell campus and was fortunate to have a great roommate — in fact we still keep in touch. I quickly made friends with all the students of color — our freshman class had the largest group of African-American and Latino students ever admitted to Cornell. However, in my courses there were never more than one or two African-American students, and sometimes there were none. With limited support from faculty or teaching assistants, there were many times when I felt invisible (and most of the classes were really large, which was also overwhelming). But I was a top student in high school and was determined to succeed at Cornell. So, I put in a lot of time at the library, found a solid study buddy, worked hard and actually graduated with honors.",
    p2: "It was a challenging time, especially for many African-American students who were experiencing difficulty dealing with faculty and courses that excluded or misrepresented African-American culture and history. These issues resulted in several demonstrations and the historic takeover of Willard Straight Hall in the spring of 1969. I participated in these events, as well as additional demonstrations when the first Africana Studies Center was destroyed by fire in the spring of 1970. Through these traumatic experiences I learned about the importance of standing up for issues that are important to you and your community.",
    p3: "The first Africana Studies Center at 320 Wait Avenue served as a place to obtain knowledge about African-American history and culture, and also as a place to connect and feel a true sense of belonging; we all need places where we feel grounded and can recharge to pursue our goals and dreams. The Africana Studies Center did that for me and my peers — it was a vital part of my existence at Cornell. It is where I got the support and validation — my home away from home. The establishment of the center was an indication that the University realized the need to invest in the success and well-being of African-American students.",
    p4: "By my junior year, a large number of students of color formed United Black Artists and shared their talents and creativity through a campus theatrical production entitled “To All Things Black and Beautiful,” under the direction of Professor Chestyn Everett.  Between studies, we rehearsed in the evening and on the weekends to create a very high quality production that included highlights from renowned African-American poetry, plays, music and dance. The production was well-received by our peers, the Cornell and Ithaca community, and was replicated the following year.  This experience reflected the need for Cornell to intentionally establish more bridges and supports for students of color as well as opportunities for engagement and interaction throughout the campus.",
    p5: "By the time my son Khalil arrived on campus in the early 90’s there were more supports. I had wanted him to be in a supportive learning environment, not experience the isolation and limited support I encountered at Cornell, and so he initially attended Morehouse College in Atlanta. However, he was already familiar with Cornell; he had attended several 4-H campus learning experiences, including a summer course through the Cooperative Extension 4-H Youth Development Program, and had come to CBAA reunions with me over the years. And so, after a year at Morehouse, he made the choice to transfer to Cornell.",
    quote1: "We all need places where we feel grounded and can recharge to pursue our goals and dreams.",
    p6: "By then, the University had established additional vehicles to support the interest of students of color such as the Third World Student Program Board, in which he participated as a member and officer, and other groups such as Black Student Union and the National Association of Black Engineers. He also resided in Ujamaa, which provided a rich and supportive environment in which he thrived.  Now there many additional programs that support students of color and other special interest groups.",
    p7: "Today, there are still demonstrations, sit-ins and rallies because there continue to be new issues and challenges we must face. As a society and a university, we take steps forward and back. What is required is that the University continue building bridges to understand, respect and provide opportunities for all members of the Cornell community. Some of today’s issues include mental health, sexual assault, ongoing micro-aggressions, unconscious bias, navigating first-generation experiences, and questions of divestment. Campus and community outreach initiatives such as Scholars Working Ambitiously to Graduate or SWAG, the Black women’s support network SISTERS, Breaking Bread and Engaged Cornell are examples of the many efforts currently underway that may help address some aspects of these issues, realizing there no quick fixes – it’s a learning and growing process for all.  We are making progress, even though we still have quite a way to go.  Hopefully, when my grandson arrives in a few years, his experience will be one where he can pursue his studies in an environment where he is at ease, engaged and fulfilled.",
    p44: "Dr. Jacqueline Davis-Manigaulte ’72 was a freshman and member the Afro-American Society at the time of the Willard Straight Hall takeover.

    p1: "Although I was only a freshman in high school when the Willard Straight Hall occupation made national news, activism on the Cornell campus was still an energizing force when I arrived in the fall of 1972. Protests continued over many societal issues in the early 1970s, most prominently the country’s continuing involvement in the Vietnam War, which resulted in a student takeover of Carpenter Hall just a few months before I began my freshman year. But between those two building occupations, other developments were underway that led to what I believe are two of the most constructive, transformative and lasting outcomes of the Straight episode of Cornell’s history.",
    p2: "The first is a university commitment to shared governance. In the immediate aftermath of the Straight occupation, the Constituent Assembly was created, comprising several hundred students, staff and faculty elected and empowered to recommend changes in the way “the university governs itself.” Its recommendations, reflecting the post-Straight campus mindset, included a fundamental shift of the University’s approach to decision-making with regard to non-academic matters, from what was a traditional, administrative-centric model to one that included the meaningful involvement of a governing body of student, faculty and non-faculty employee representatives.",
    p3: "The Constituent Assembly soon evolved into the University Senate, as the former’s recommendations were implemented. For the first time in Cornell’s history, shared governance had been legitimized, with authority delegated to the Senate by the trustees.",
    p4: "Precisely because the Senate was a representative group with meaningful responsibilities, it served as a magnet for talent, attracting world-class faculty like Geoffrey Chester, Michael Fisher and Mary Beth Norton; legendary employees like George Peter; and committed students like me.",
    p5: "A lot has changed since then, as that initial shared governance structure has evolved into the representative bodies we have today: the Student Assembly, the Graduate and Professional Student Assembly, the Employee Assembly, the University Assembly and the Faculty Senate. While the jurisdiction of the current assemblies is different, the importance of constituent representation and two-way communication, the University Senate’s legacy, remains. Listening to community input — and taking it seriously — is now deeply ingrained in the behavior of the administration and the Board of Trustees. Since becoming chairman in 2012, I have invited the presidents of the assemblies to join us at board meetings, and leadership of the board meets with leadership of the assemblies during our visits to Ithaca for face-to-face, give-and-take sessions.",
    quote1: "For the first time in Cornell’s history, shared governance had been legitimized.",
    p6: "A second positive and lasting outcome of the Straight occupation is the inclusion of student, faculty and employee representatives on the Board of Trustees. Prior to that time, the board was predominantly comprised of alumni from the fields of business and finance. It was a rather insular, self-perpetuating club whose understanding of issues facing the campus was largely derived from presentations by the university administration.",
    p7: "In an effort to inject a dose of representative democracy into the board, the Constituent Assembly recommended that community-elected trustees be added to the University’s governing body. Since 1971, Cornell has embraced faculty-elected and student-elected trustees as full voting members, and since 1975, employee-elected trustees have also been included. None of our Ivy League peers has any community-elected board members.",
    p8: "I served as a student trustee in the mid-1970s, and I have served as an alumni and board-elected trustee since 2002. I believe we make better decisions because student, faculty and employee trustees attend board and committee meetings and participate in all significant discussions and decisions, including invaluable service on presidential search committees. They serve as two-way communication channels, which was sadly lacking during the events leading up to the 1969 Straight occupation, and they ensure that board decisions take campus priorities, sensitivities and reactions into account. Importantly, they also view their role the way all trustees must — as fiduciaries — with the long-term best interest of the entire university always in mind.",
    p9: "This is not the way it was in the early days of community-elected trustees. When I was a student trustee, community-elected trustees were often aggressively partisan representatives of their constituencies. This should not be surprising, given that community representatives suddenly found themselves with seats at the table where university policy was made, quite soon after so much societal upheaval, particularly on the Cornell campus.",
    p10: "I remember two student trustees who sued the University, and another who leaked confidential board materials to The Cornell Daily Sun, to advance their views of student interests. These actions made good headlines, but they eviscerated the credibility, trustworthiness and effectiveness of those student trustees in the boardroom.",
    p11: "Since my return to the board in 2002, I have never had any doubt about the credibility or trustworthiness of any community-elected trustee.",
    p12: "When the board is in Ithaca, leadership regularly meets with groups of students organized by the student trustees around important campus issues. Recent gatherings have included first-generation students, transgender students, program house leaders, teaching assistants, student athletes, Greek system representatives, students with disabilities, and student political leaders. These sessions ensure that trustees hear unfiltered feedback about what’s working and what needs to be fixed.",
    p13: "Cornellians will continue to debate many aspects of the controversial events of April 1969 for many years, but there is no doubt in my mind that one beneficiary has been university governance, which is more participatory, diverse, transparent and better-informed than it has ever been.",

    p1: "The takeover of Willard Straight Hall on April 19, 1969 by dozens of Black and a handful of Latino students was a direct outgrowth of the Civil Rights, Black power, Black arts and Black student movements of the 1960s. In her book, The Black Revolution on Campus, Northwestern Professor Martha Biondi wrote, “Black student activism exploded in the spring of 1969. It was the high-water mark of the Black student movement, with militant actions and mass confrontations at campuses across the country, most notably at the University of California, Berkeley; Cornell University; Harvard University; Rutgers University; and Howard University.” The militancy that Biondi wrote about was simply Black students demanding to be treated with dignity and respect and being placed on an equal playing field with whites. It is important to keep in mind that during the 1960s America was racially divided. This was drilled home in the Kerner Commission report commissioned by President Lyndon B. Johnson, which famously warned that America was “moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal.”  ",
    p2: "This racial divide played out at Cornell well before the events of April 1969. One such example can be found in the Economics Department in the spring of 1968. Black students felt that a visiting professor in that department was teaching with a racist approach. After the students exhausted every avenue to have their grievances heard, they had a sit-in in the department’s offices to protest this faculty member, ironically on the same day that Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated. These two events would lead to the forming of a committee to look into the creation of a Black Studies department, and would eventually result in the founding of the Africana Studies & Research Center.",
    p3: "But even before the establishment of the Center, it is important to point out that Black students expected Cornell to live up to the words of Ezra Cornell: “I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.” A letter written by Andrew Dickson White would also show that the founders of Cornell strove for a diverse student body. When asked by an associate if Cornell would accept a Black student, White responded, “I would say that we have no colored students at the University at present but shall be very glad to receive any who are prepared to enter… we should receive him even if all our five hundred white students were to ask for dismissal on that account.” These words by both Ezra Cornell and A.D. White are significant, and upon reflection helped laid a foundation of student activism at Cornell, activism that sought to hold each successive University administration to the ideals espoused by the founders themselves. The actions of the Black students who occupied Willard Straight Hall were a powerful — and necessary — continuation of that legacy of activism.",
    p4: "In the film Agents of Change, filmmakers Frank Dawson ’72, who participated in the occupation of the Straight as a freshman, and Abby Ginzberg ’71, who stood in support of the occupation as a member of Students for a Democratic Society, captured not only what happened at Cornell but most notably concurrent events at San Francisco State College. One of the telling parts of this documentary is the footage of Edward Whitfield, then president of the Afro-American Society at Cornell, when he announced that the Straight had been taken over because of Cornell’s racist attitudes and irrelevant curriculum.  As we move forward, it is important for us to embrace the legacy of the occupation and to continue to dialogue about how we can enhance the educational experiences of all students, and develop a relevant and engaging curriculum at this institution.",

    p1: "ifty years ago this month, I, like most other Cornellians, was caught up in the events surrounding the occupation of Willard Straight Hall by members of the African-American Society (AAS), who later armed themselves. Unlike many of my fellow seniors who had spent countless hours working on the Cornell Daily Sun until the middle of our senior year, I spent much time as Senior Editor after the Straight takeover writing op ed columns, news articles and a feature story about the events that roiled Cornell.",
    p2: "The conflicts became all the more real to me because one of my roommates had been marching around the Straight with members of Students for a Democratic Society in support of the black students who were inside. Another roommate strongly opposed the administration’s agreement to settle the takeover, believing that the settlement had indelibly eradicated the rule of law — the principle that procedures for addressing alleged student misconduct must be followed.",
    p3: "The Straight takeover involved a conflict between two fervently held principles — opposition to perceived institutional racism against black students and support for the rule of law on campus. It also presented an incredibly complex situation with at least eight different players — (1)the black student members of AAS, (2) SDS, (3) the nine or ten thousand students who attended vigils and teach-ins at Barton Hall, (4) the faculty, (5) some members of Delta Upsilon fraternity (6), the university administration, (7) supporters of the rule of law, and, (8) in the background, several hundred police officers ready to end the takeover if called upon to do so. Under any circumstances, resolution of a conflict with so many players would be extremely difficult. In April 1969, resolution of the conflict was all the more difficult because of the presence of weapons that the AAS members brought into the Straight to defend themselves from perceived outside threats.",
    p4: "The takeover was precipitated by the burning of a cross on the lawn of Wari House, a black women’s cooperative, and reprimands handed down to three black students for destruction of property at protests the previous December. At its core, however, the takeover stemmed from distrust and lack of communication between black students, many of whom had been recruited to attend Cornell as part of the COSEP program, and an otherwise nearly all white faculty and student body. This distrust and lack of communication followed the assassinations the previous year of Dr. Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. With their deaths, violent protests for racial equality and against the war in Vietnam raged throughout the country, including at many college campuses. Cornell, however, was the first campus at which students, rather than the police, were armed, a move the black students said was taken in self-defense after members of the DU fraternity entered the Straight in order to evict the AAS students.",
    p5: "Because of the black students’ weapons, the university administration’s immediate goal was to have the AAS students evacuate the Straight without any injuries or deaths. The university was concerned not only about the armed AAS students, but about the gathering of several hundred police officers in Ithaca, ready to descend on campus. As then Dean of the Faculty Robert Miller stated in the March/April 2019 issue of the Cornell Alumni magazine, \“I think if it had gone another night, the odds were at least one in five that we would have had some shooting.\”",
    quote1: "The takeover stemmed from distrust and lack of communication between black students ... and an otherwise nearly all white faculty and student body.",
    p6: "Although the administration succeeded in getting the AAS students to leave the Straight before any shots had been fired, this settlement was viewed by many as a coerced capitulation to the black students and an end to the rule of law on campus. What most people did not know when the AAS students exited the Straight brandishing their weapons was that the guns were not loaded, as then Vice President for Public Affairs Steven Muller told me in a Sun interview shortly after the takeover.",
    p7: "The faculty first upheld the reprimands of the black students, but reversed course two days later, an action many people felt was coerced. Indeed, after the first faculty vote, Tom Jones ’69, MRP’72 told an Ithaca radio station that Cornell had “three hours to live” and menaced several faculty and administrators by name. This rhetoric and the university’s settlement with AAS led several prominent faculty members to resign, including government department chair Allan Sindler. Those faculty members declared that because of the AAS students’ weapons, Cornell was no longer a place where their academic freedom would be preserved.",
    p8: "Amidst the faculty vote and revote, thousands of students gathered at Barton Hall for almost a week to discuss the events surrounding the takeover and hear the views of AAS and SDS members, as well as the positions of various faculty members. Some of the discussion concerned taking over Day Hall in violation of administration edicts. This, in turn, led to a declaration that the students would instead take over Barton Hall, a move that seemed defiant until the administration supported students staying there.",
    p9: "The daily meetings and teach-ins at Barton Hall served a salutary purpose, helping to educate the mostly white student body of the basis for the AAS students’ concerns. This point was driven home to me when reading a Sun article by Sam Pizzigati written the Tuesday after the Straight takeover. The article quoted an angry white student outside the Straight on the day of the takeover as saying, \“I’m no racist, but those coloreds have just gone too far this time.\” The article also quoted AAS president Edward Whitfield ’71 as saying that a top government professor questioned the value of him taking a black literature course. According to Whitfield, \“For that professor, reading black literature was like reading pornography.\”",
    p10: "Of course, issues of race have plagued our country since its inception. Three provisions in the Constitution, including the Three Fifths Clause, addressed slavery without using that word. Continued racial divisions led to the Civil War and then the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment prohibiting slavery. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld segregation in 1896 in Plessy v. Ferguson; it was not until 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education that the Supreme Court reversed course. More recently, the Supreme Court held that part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was unconstitutional, and racial divisions continue today with white police officers shooting unarmed black men in city after city, leading to the Black Lives Matter movement.",
    p11: "Nevertheless, I remain optimistic that our society is moving both toward racial equality and upholding the rule of law, both on campus and elsewhere. Dr. King and others are quoted as saying, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” In a small way, this was evidenced in a Cornell press release issued this month stating that three new faculty members who specialize in African American literature will be joining the faculty this fall. What a far cry from Whitfield’s perception that a government professor equated studying black literature with reading pornography!",
    p12: "At the courthouse in Colorado where I work, another well-known quote from Dr. King emblazoned in large letters at the entrance is worth remembering: \“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” Injustice has always been with us, and will continue to challenge us. As Cornellians, we should strive to root out injustice whether on campus or in the communities in which we live. As I wrote in an op ed column 50 years ago, \“The peculiar responsibility of our generation remains succeeding where our parents have failed. We must be willing to understand the problems which confront us, and having understood, begin to solve them.\”",

Most people are aware that there were many students involved in each effort. Some estimates indicate that between nine & ten thousand people were in Barton at one point. ",
    p2: "Black student leaders such as Tom Jones, Eric Evans and Ed Whitfield, spoke to those gathered in Barton. Various \"representatives\" of Students for a Democratic Society, such as Joe Kelly, Chip Marshall and Jeff Dowd, also put forth their perspectives regarding how we should proceed.",
    p3: "At one point, Tom Jones made his \"historic\"  (& histrionic) speech, declaring, \"the university has an hour left to live if our demands aren't met.\" At that point, I mentioned to Chip - an SDS co-chair - that I thought Tom had \"lost it.\" However, thousands of people were cheering, so I don't think he heard or understood what I was saying. His great-great-great, etc. grandfather, John Marshall, might've been rolling over in his grave.",
    p4: "Fortunately, more objective tactical thinking prevailed, and we were able to gain popular support for a vote to declare Barton Hall occupied, and thereby avoid having students manipulated into a knee-jerk effort to march on and seize Day Hall. A Sergeant  from the IPD later told me that any effort to takeover Day Hall would've triggered a green light for the deputies to come onto campus and open fire. Thus there would've been a lot of dead bodies and a lot of beat-down students.",
    p5: "What we were able to do to avoid bloodshed & brutality was form a loose coalition of people, many from the political center, including athletes and a number of students from Greek organizations, along with progressives from Students for a Democratic Society and sympathetic faculty and clergy, and, of course, African American student leaders who were willing to hold off any further action until after the faculty voted a second time on the agreement. Later that night  even CU President James Perkins made a public statement of support for the occupation of Barton.",
    quote1: "What we were able to do to avoid bloodshed & brutality was form a loose coalition of people, many from the political center.",
    p6: "In any case, the next morning, when a significant contingent of the students who had spent the night sleeping under the bleachers in Barton were asking \"what should we do between now & the (crucial) faculty meeting later today,\" the students were asked to attempt to persuade their professors to look at the range of anti-racist protests in the larger historical context. ",
    p7: "I personally got some positive feedback from student protestors who used this approach. Most of them reported a significant degree of success re: communicating with their profs, and the majority faculty vote in support of the agreement between black students and the administration provided further substantiation that the persuasive approach helped win the day.",
    p8: "Let me close with a reference to comments made last June by NYC Attorney Zachary Carter, a  former leader of the AAS/BLF during the time of the Straight Takeover. After a screening of AGENTS OF CHANGE, a documentary which treats both the Straight Takeover and the mass student protests (re: the development of a Latino/a Studies at San Francisco State), Zach said that seeing how SF State student protestors were beaten & jailed for long periods is an indication that,  \"We were lucky to have\" (James) Perkins and (Dale) Corson as leaders at Cornell.",
