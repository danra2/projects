              The amount that Huawei paid Cornell is significantly larger than the 
              $1.4 million that the company paid in total to its next largest 
              research partner in American academia, U.C. Berkeley. Furthermore, 
              according to DOED data, the U.C. Berkeley payouts were “monetary gifts.” 
              Meanwhile, Cornell received their payments for “contracts,” which the DOED 
              <a href="https://ifap.ed.gov/fsahandbook/attachments/1718FSAHbkVol2Ch6.pdf" target="_blank"> defines </a>
              as a financial interaction in which the donor purchases, leases or 
              barters property or services from the university.

              <p className="bodyparas-hw">
              All other Huawei contracts with U.S. universities were much smaller, 
              with each contracted university receiving less than $600,000 in total 
              over the six-year period.

              <p className="bodyparas-hw">
              The financial relationship is one of Cornell’s largest as well. After 
              Novo Nordisk — a Danish pharmaceutical company that 
              <a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/04/novo-nordisk-commits-nearly-7-million-minglin-mas-diabetes-research" target="_blank"> paid Cornell roughly $6.6 million </a>
              for a contract for diabetes research — Huawei is Cornell’s second-largest 
              foreign corporate contributor.

            The DOED data may not report the entirety of the University’s monetary 
            relationship with Huawei. The federal data only includes money transfers 
            completed as of June 2018; hence, it does not contain any details about 
            Huawei’s unfulfilled financial commitments to U.S. colleges and universities.

                For example, the DOED data states that U.C. Berkeley only received $1.4

            Mogulof confirmed to The Sun that Huawei has committed to paying

            the fact that U.C. Berkeley suspended talks for future contracts with the 
            tech giant. Cornell did not clarify whether it also has similar long-term
